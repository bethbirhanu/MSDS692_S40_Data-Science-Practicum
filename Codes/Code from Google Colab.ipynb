Was the baby shower fun?\\n\\n   I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago\\n   essays\\n   later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if\\n   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your\\n   home\\n   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so\\n   tonight).\\n\\n   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained\\n   a\\n   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty\\n   frustrated\\n   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday\\n   telling\\n   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk\\n   /\\n   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's\\n   afraid\\n   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --\\n   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.\\n\\n   Livia\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis e-mail is the property of Enron Corp. and/or its relevant affiliate\\nand may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of\\nthe intended recipient (s).

Especially if you have to prepare a presentation.  I would suggest holding the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business meetings.  I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is even desired or necessary.\\n\\nAs far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working and what is not.  Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet just waiting for their turn.   The meetings might be better if held in a round table discussion format.  \\n\\nMy suggestion for where to go is Austin.  Play golf and rent a ski boat and jet ski's.  Flying somewhere takes too much time.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

I have changed the unit mix to include some 1 bedrooms and reduced the number of buildings to 12.  Kipp Flores is working on the construction drawings.  At the same time I am pursuing FHA financing.  Once the construction drawings are complete I will send them to you for a revised bid.  Your original bid was competitive and I am still attracted to your firm because of your strong local presence and contacts.\\n\\nPhillip                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

After reviewing the  agreement?I find it isn't binding \\nas far as I can determine.? It is  too vague and it doesn't sound like \\nanything an attorney or title company  would?draft for a real estate \\nclosing--but, of course, I could be  wrong.? \\n?\\nIf this?closing is going to take place without  this agreement then there is \\nno point in me  following up on this?document's validity.? \\n?\\nI will just need to go back to my closing documents  and see what's there and \\nfind out where I am with that and deal with this as  best I can.\\n?\\nI guess I was expecting something that would be an  exhibit to a recordable \\ndocument or something a little more exact, or  rather?sort of a contract.? \\nThis isn't either.? I tried to get a  real estate atty on the phone last \\nnight but he was out of pocket.? I  talked to a crim. atty friend and he said \\nthis is out of his area but doesn't  sound binding to him.? \\n?\\nI will go back to mine and Phillip Allen's  transaction?and take a look at \\nthat but as vague and general as this is I  doubt that my signature? is even \\nneeded to complete this transaction.?  I am in after 12 noon if there is any \\nneed to contact me regarding the  closing.\\n?\\nI really do not want to hold up anything or  generate more work for myself \\nand I don't want to insult or annoy anyone but  this paper really doesn't \\nseem to be something required for a closing.? In  the event you do need my \\nsignature on something like this I would rather have  time to have it \\nreviewed before I accept it.\\n?\\nBrenda\\n?\\n?\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
